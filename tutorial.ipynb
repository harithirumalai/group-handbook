    "A significant portion of the research conducted in the group pertains to computational modeling in which various properties of interest for a system are calculated by means of /ab initio/ density functional theory calculations. We refer the reader to an excellent [book](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Density+Functional+Theory%3A+A+Practical+Introduction-p-9780470373170) that delves on the nuts and bolts of DFT by David Sholl. These calculations are computationally intensive and are exclusively performed on computing clusters or supercomputers. These massively-parallel machines are accessed remotely through the [Secure Shell Protocol](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/protocol) and the user is able to access his or her account on that machine. Once logged in, the user sets up these jobs and submits them to the system's resource manager, or the queue. Once resources become available, the queue executes the job and the user is notified upon completion of the job."

Maxwell is managed by the [Torque Resource Manager](http://www.adaptivecomputing.com/products/open-source/torque/).

    "## Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE)\n",
    "ASE is an Atomic Simulation Environment written in the Python programming language with the aim of setting up, steering, and analyzing atomistic simulations (adapted from [ASE](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/about.html)). The ASE has been constructed with a number of “design goals” that make it:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Easy to use:\n",
    "Setting up an atomistic total energy calculation or molecular dynamics simulation with ASE is simple and straightforward. ASE can be used via a graphical user interface, Command line tools and the Python language. Python scripts are easy to follow (see What is Python? for a short introduction). It is simple for new users to get access to all of the functionality of ASE.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Flexible:\n",
    "Since ASE is based on the Python scripting language it is possible to perform very complicated simulation tasks without any code modifications. For example, a sequence of calculations may be performed with the use of simple “for-loop” constructions. There exist ASE modules for performing many standard simulation tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Customizable:\n",
    "The Python code in ASE is structured in modules intended for different purposes. There are ase.calculators for calculating energies, forces and stresses, ase.md and ase.optimize modules for controlling the motion of atoms, constraints objects and filters for performing nudged-elastic-band calculations etc. The modularity of the object-oriented code make it simple to contribute new functionality to ASE.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pythonic:\n",
    "It fits nicely into the rest of the Python world with use of the popular NumPy package for numerical work (see Numeric arrays in Python for a short introduction). The use of the Python language allows ASE to be used both interactively as well as in scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing ASE\n",
    "ASE is a bundle of python modules which can be invoked or loaded when atomic simulations are required to be set up or analyzed. The easiest way of installing ase, is to download the latest source tar ball from the website. Once downloaded, the tar ball must be extracted, and installation can be completed by running \n",
    "```\n",
    "python setup.py install --user\n",
    "```\n",
    "Tt is necessary to add the installation path in your *=.cshrc=* file and add ~/.local/bin to the front of your PATH environment variable. This is dependent on the system you are using. Adding this location onto your ```$PATH``` environment variable enables you to access ```ase-gui``` and ```ase-db``` from any location on the system. "

    "### Building gas phase molecules\n",
    "Smaller models involving gas phase molecules and simple surfaces are usually built up from scratch, using the modules and functions availble in ```ase```. This can either be done through scripting or through the ```ase-gui``` interface. Extensive documentation on using the ```ase-gui``` can be accessed in the ASE [documentation](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/gui/gui.html). Here, we will provide a quick introduction on creating different systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most simple demonstration to begin with would be to model a simple gas phase molecule such as $H_{2}O$. ASE provides a number of ways to build and modify models, and we will explore two ways. 1) using python scripting and 2) using the ASE Graphical user interface ```ase-gui```. We recommend that you use scripting wherever possible as this keeps track of all changes made to the model including the documentation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Gas phase models are the simplest models to create and are the least expensive in terms of computational processing requirements. Such systems require that they are enclosed in a vacuum cell of certain dimensions that depends on the dimensions of the model itself. The presence of this cell ensures that when DFT calculations are performed and periodic boundary conditions are implemented in $x$, $y$ and $z$ directions, there is minimal interaction between the neighboring images. Hence, one should perform calculations to ensure that energies and cell sizes are well converged, before proceeding to use data from these calculations.\n",

For instance, by looking at the slab generated by ASE one can see that the exposed surface in +z direction has a oxygen termination, that might not be (and is not) the most stable termination. However, by deleting \"extra\" oxygen atoms on top, we are also changing the Zr/O ratio. The surface slab is now no longer stoichiometric ($Zr_{10}O_{18}$ instead of $Zr_{10}O_{20}$. There are multiple solutions to these problems and the best solution depends on the case. This is usually not a problem for simple metal surfaces that are highly symetrical and pure.\n",

At the end, is possible that we need to shift the position of all atoms in the cell in order to keep the center of mass in the center of the cell. We are going to use a similar script to create a slab with an extra layer and then delete some of the atoms, so we keep only 5 layers in total."

Currently installed versions are 5.4.1 and 5.4.4. There is no performance benefit of using one version over the other. It is a matter of your choice. Calculation times are dependent on the size of the system and more specifically, the number of valence electrons. Calculations for small systems converge to their ground state configurations fairly quickly. However, large systems may sometimes run for many weeks. It is for this reason that ```VASP``` is run parallely across many processors and nodes.

First, the calculator stores information about the model, the elements, the stoichiometry and the cartesian coordinates. Based on the calculator parameters written in by the user, and combining them with defaults, it stores the entire list of parameters and creates the ```INCAR```, ```POTCAR``` and ```KPOINTS``` files. Finally, the user is free to call ```Vasp``` at his or her convenience and run the calculation."

This is usually done by setting an [Environment Variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable) called ```$VASP_EXEC``` in your jobscript. When you submit your jobscript to the queue, it will load the specific ```VASP``` executable (```vasp_std, vasp_gam```) specified by the user in this environment variable. A simple jobscript, assuming that the cif file is in the same folder, is shown below"

    "    - Job canceled due to wall time\n",
    "        - This means your calculation ran out of time. Restart and request more time (```#SBATCH -t #####```). Can also copy ```CONTCAR``` to a ```POSCAR``` file and restart calculation so you don’t have to repeat any unnecessary optimization steps. For reference, the ```CONTCAR``` contains the geometric information of the final configuration before the job was terminated by ```SLURM```, and the ```POSCAR``` contains geometric information about the initial configuration.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - Segmentation or MPI errors\n",
    "        - Restart calculation. Sometimes, nodes or processors run into unexpected errors and this can be rectified by restarting the job.\n",
    "        - Run on different cluster. The job might be such that it requires a lot more memory to run efficiently than is available on that machine. \n",
    "    \n",

    "2. Check ```VASP``` Output files\n",
    "    - ```OUTCAR```\n",
    "        - Scan the first few hundred lines (```more OUTCAR```, then press space to quickly scroll down, ```ctrl-c``` to exit). There should not be any ‘VERY BAD NEWS’ or huge ‘WARNINGS.’ \n",
    "        - Aliasing errors are fine unless doing high accuracy bader charge analysis.\n",
    "        - If you see an ```NCORE``` setting error, check ```NPAR``` settings in ```INCAR``` for specific cluster/number of cores\n",
    "        - Large supercell warnings can be mostly ignored.\n",
    "        - For some systems you may need to increase NBANDS manually (check documentation/system)\n",
    "    - ```vasprun.xml```\n",
    "        - Check the bottom of the ```vasprun.xml``` file (```tail -n 20 vasprun.xml```) The last line should be ```</modeling>```. If not, that means the calculation didn’t completely finish for whatever reason.\n",
    "    - OSZICAR\n",
    "        - Includes information about each electronic relaxation for each ionic step. Final line is the energy of the system, check against any sort of printed energy file to verify accuracy.\n",
