    "The aim of this document is to help users who are new to the concepts and tools used in the group. By the end of this tutorial, the reader will should have a basic understanding of the various components of typical computational research workflows, starting from basic Linux commands to running calculations using VASP and other softwares. This document was not designed to be a thorough guide and the user is encourage to complement the information provided here with extensive Google searches.\n",

    "A significant portion of the research conducted in the group pertains to computational modeling in which various properties of interest for a system are calculated by means of /ab initio/ density functional theory calculations. We refer the reader to an excellent [book](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Density+Functional+Theory%3A+A+Practical+Introduction-p-9780470373170) that delves on the nuts and bolts of DFT by David Sholl. These calculations are computationally intensive and are exclusively performed on computing clusters or supercomputers. These massively-parallel machines are accessed remotely through the [Secure Shell Protocol](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/protocol) and the user is able to access his or her account on that machine. Once logged in, the user sets up these jobs and submits them to the system's resource manager, or the queue. Once resources become available, the queue executes the job and the user is notified upon completion of the job."

Maxwell is managed by the [Torque Resource Manager](http://www.adaptivecomputing.com/products/open-source/torque/).

    "ASE is an Atomic Simulation Environment written in the Python programming language with the aim of setting up, steering, and analyzing atomistic simulations (adapted from [[https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/about.html][ASE]]). The ASE has been constructed with a number of “design goals” that make it:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Easy to use:\n",
    "Setting up an atomistic total energy calculation or molecular dynamics simulation with ASE is simple and straightforward. ASE can be used via a graphical user interface, Command line tools and the Python language. Python scripts are easy to follow (see What is Python? for a short introduction). It is simple for new users to get access to all of the functionality of ASE.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Flexible:\n",
    "Since ASE is based on the Python scripting language it is possible to perform very complicated simulation tasks without any code modifications. For example, a sequence of calculations may be performed with the use of simple “for-loop” constructions. There exist ASE modules for performing many standard simulation tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Customizable:\n",
    "The Python code in ASE is structured in modules intended for different purposes. There are ase.calculators for calculating energies, forces and stresses, ase.md and ase.optimize modules for controlling the motion of atoms, constraints objects and filters for performing nudged-elastic-band calculations etc. The modularity of the object-oriented code make it simple to contribute new functionality to ASE.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pythonic:\n",
    "It fits nicely into the rest of the Python world with use of the popular NumPy package for numerical work (see Numeric arrays in Python for a short introduction). The use of the Python language allows ASE to be used both interactively as well as in scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**** Installing ASE\n",
    "ASE is a bundle of python modules which can be invoked or loaded when atomic simulations are required to be set up or analyzed.

    "**** Building gas phase molecules\n",
    "Smaller models involving gas phase molecules and systems on simple surfaces are usually built up from scratch, using the modules and functions availble in ase. This can either be done through scripting or through the =ase-gui= interface. Extensive documentation on using the =ase-gui= can be accessed on the ASE website at [[https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/gui/gui.html][Link]]. Here, we will provide a quick introduction on creating different systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most simple demonstration to begin with, would be to model a simple gas phase molecule such as H_{2}O. ASE provides a number of ways to build and modify models, and we will explore two ways. 1) using python scripting and 2) using the ASE Graphical user interface. We recommend that you use scripting wherever possible as this keeps track of all changes made to the model, whenever documentation is necessary. \n",
    "\n",
    "Gas phase models are the simplest models to make, and are the least expesive in terms of computational processing time. Such systems require that they are enclosed in a vacuum cell of certain dimensions, depending on the size of the model itself. The presence and size of this cell ensures that when DFT calculations are performed, and periodic boundary conditions are implemented in X, Y and Z directions, there is minimal interaction energy between the models. Hence, one should perform calculations to ensure that energies and cell sizes are well converged, before proceeding to use data from these calculations.\n",

    "Even though you can provide of very reliable experimental information, the atomic positions and cell size and shape usually need to be computationally optimized before can be used to generate a surface or for energy comparisons.

    "Even though this procedure is very simple, one needs to be really careful in the selection of the surface termination. For instance, by looking at the slab generated by ASE one can see that the exposed surface in +z direction has a oxygen termination, that might not be (and is not) the most stable termination. However, by deleting this \"extra\" oxygen atoms on top, we are also changing the Zr/O ratio. The surface slab is now no longer stoichiometric (Zr_{10}O_{18} instead of Zr_{10}O_{20}). Is usually a good idea to keep the stoichiometry in order to avoid strong polarization (##is this right??). This is usually not a problem for simple metal surfaces that are highly symetrical or are built by only one distinguishable metal.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to solve this problem can be creating a slab with an extra layer and then deleting the atoms that are not longer needed in order to maintain the desirable number of layers. At the end, is possible that we need to shift the position of all atoms in the cell in order to keep the center of mass in the center of the cell. We are going to use a similar script to create a slab with an extra layer and then delete some of the atoms, so we keep only 5 layers in total.\n",

Currently installed =VASP= versions are 5.3.5 and 5.4.1. There is no performance benefit of using one over the other. It is a matter of your choice. Calculation times are dependent on the size of the system, and more specifically, the number of electrons. Calculations for small systems converge to their ground states very quickly. However large systems may sometimes run for many weeks. It is for this reason that =VASP= is run parallely across many processors or nodes.

    "The snippet of code shown above creates all the files required by =VASP=. Creation of files is done in the following manner. First, the calculator stores information about the model, the elements, the stoichiometry and the cartesian coordinates. Based on the calculator parameters written in by the user, and combining them with defaults, it stores the entire list of parameters and creates the =INCAR= file. Based on the parameters, and the type of atoms, it creates the =POTCAR= and =KPOINTS= files. Finally, the user is free to call vasp at his or her convenience. \n",

    "We have created all required files for a calculation. The next course of action is to invoke =VASP=. This is usually done by setting an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable][Environment Variable]] called 'VASP_EXEC' in your jobscript. When you submit your jobscript to the queue, it will load the specific =VASP= specified by you in this environment variable. A simple jobscript, assuming that the cif file is in the same folder, is shown below\n",
